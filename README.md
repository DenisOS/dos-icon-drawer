# dos icon drawer
A self contained ui widget based on the idea of the [material design drawer](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html), [angular material sidenav](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/sidenav) and built using similar coding patterns used in ui-bootstrap tabs as well as other important inspiration.

Implemented using angularjs (v1.x) directives including:
+ ```<dos-icon-drawer>``` represents a drawer ui control which has an icon bar and content panels (```<dos-drawer-panel>```);
+ ```<dos-drawer-panel>``` represents the content for one icon, can be one or more of these drawer panels
+ Clicking an icon in the icon drawer will display the corresponding drawer panel
